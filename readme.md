#Ellis 
##A content migration tool

Created by Blend Interactive Inc.  Ellis is a tool used to manage the process of transferring content between CMS's.  Ellis retrieves the content of a text file of URLs, extracts text from them using a XPath-like syntax, runs a series of filters on the extracted content, and outputs to a variety of different forms.

Special thanks to Jeff Klawiter (@jeffklawiter), as the maintainer of HTMLAgilityPack, the core HTML-parsing library that Ellis is built around.
